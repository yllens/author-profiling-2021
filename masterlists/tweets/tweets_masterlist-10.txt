@NadineDorries You realise what you sound like? You are saying they should feel lucky that they haven't lost their jobs. Do you even understand the trauma and loss they have suffered. Moral was at it's lowest ever before the pandemic. The @Conservatives won't be happy until the NHS is destroyed

3/3) Now, NYT and WSJ reported that New York deliberately under reported nursing home deaths from COVID-19 by upto 50%. In a July report, the government said a little over 6,000 had died from the outbreak. That number was actually 9,000.  #AndrewCuomo #Cuomo #COVID19 #coronavirus

@doctor_oxford While I agree the Drs, Nurses &amp; immediate support staff dealing with covid patients deserve a rise. Remember the NHS is massive, over 1.3 million staff of those about 300,000 Nurses and 123,000 Drs. Lots of staff have little to do with patient care. They are other front lines .

@GMB @NadineDorries You will have some really pissed off people if we reward a service responsible for 1000s of deaths through withdrawing treatments to protect themselves. Many many people have worked through the pandemic and kept things going but have been ignored
@OLovekill @no1macster @SkySportsNews Most of the vulnerable population have been vaccinated though. We will have to treat it like the flu and we'll probably need yearly COVID jabs to protect against variants.

@Amoeba12341 And the critics of Texas for opening up their economy are silent on the newly opened southern border to the untested for COVID-19.

@johndjasper @Jos_photos1 I get why you worry. But there's enough testing and evidence from these and other vaccines that there's a very small risk of long term nasties. There's a very large risk of covid infection giving you something long term and very nasty. On balance vaccine is your lower risk.

nothing fucks me up more than knowing. the sheer amount of research our society has done into pandemics and epidemiology and how covid has played out exactly the way so many experts had hypothesised and simulated. and yet.
Even as #vaccines emerge to fight #COVID19, the lives of many #Valley residents remain in a state of uncertainty. A sense of #pandemicfatigue. simply has people wondering: What‚Äôs next? When can we get back to normal? And what will a post-pandemic ‚Äúnormal‚Äù look like?

@StevenRutt81 I don‚Äôt think it will shrink per se, but that report spurred a lot of states to commit significant dollars to upskilling nurses. I think some of that momentum may wear off. But the pandemic has also driven demand for healthcare programs so that could entirely negate it for a bit!

(a) No offence taken. (b) All pandemics and epidemics eventually end but that doesn't mean the virus or coronavirus entirely disappears. It often means so many people have had it, or have been vaccinated, that the infections no longer reach epidemic or pandemic levels. https://t.co/YcQ0DWE8Ck

@RealMattCouch Not really tho. Think about it, if every symptom is a symptom of covid, and covid is a way to scare people more easily, why would flu exist anymore?

@withlovechou What a surprise. I didn‚Äôt expect you stalk his Instagram account! And yes, my love. I always wear the masks every where I go, and for you too, it‚Äôs important to wear the mask always when you go out also with the hand sanitizer! Stay healthy, dear!
@AudreLawdAMercy All signage should be updated to read ‚ÄúNo Shirt, No Shoes, No Mask, No Service‚Äù, they could revert to take-out only though I‚Äôm sure that would would mean lay-offs, or if you w/i without a mask &amp; start screaming when they ask you to wear one you get a shot of Lysol in the face
