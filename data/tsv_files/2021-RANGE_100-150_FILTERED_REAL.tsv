TheraseWeeks	@GeorgeCockroft It is more infectious and spreads faster. That's the thing about lockdown rules.

Sanityland	@FredCDobbes A Canadian company told the federal government they could produce #COVID19 vaccines in Canada. They were completely ignored by the Trudeau government. Trudeau preferred a China company to make vaccines. The very country that unleashed the virus world wide and lied about it.
davidjthunder	@NellyTells @Colin_Cambray It is very likely that PART of excess mortality is caused by Covid interventions. How much exactly is hard to say.
RhysParton	@Cas_Arrows And those cases happened when the outbreak got out of control in federal Aged Care Homes, that‚Äôs my point.

davidjthunder	Ireland made a mess of managing its health services, &amp; the waiting lists were extraordinarily long. Then we blamed the saturation of our hospitals on SARS-CoV-2 &amp; suddenly told people to stop socialising &amp; working. We had nearly 6 months to prep hospitals for a winter resurgence. https://t.co/ECR4eomzQL
davidjthunder	In many places, the idea of decentralising the public health decisions was only half-heartedly embraced before the pandemic, &amp; local authorities were not empowered during the pandemic. It is possible that the disempowerment of local health authorities led to preventable deaths. https://t.co/a0rojXNv6B
mummygirl	@bbc5live @deeksj @rachelburden @BBCSounds It just gave 700 people a testing job that was unemployed. The first lockdown smashed the tier employment with the EU or ESF funded work programme. Trying to start an engine.
davidjthunder	I wrote this on 15/3/2020, the day the Irish govt closed bars, a few days after closure of schools &amp; colleges. I favoured voluntary social distancing under the advice of public authorities. I had no idea at the time that Ireland &amp; UK would impose INDEFINITE, draconian lockdowns. https://t.co/d1fM37JkL4
davidjthunder	This is what I thought about VOLUNTARY masking on March 26, 2020, when info on Covid-19 was still fresh.
